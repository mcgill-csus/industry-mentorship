# Capstone Project Deliverable 1

## Instructions

As a part of the program, you are required to submit three deliverables for the capstone project. The first deliverable concerns with writing an initial version of your project design doc.

If you are not yet familiar with what a design doc actually is, you may refer to this [handout](https://mcgill-csus.github.io/industry-mentorship/design-doc). The handout goes over in detail about explaining what a software design document is, what are the different components you can include in the doc, some examples, technical writing tips, and additional resources to refer to.

As always, please reach out to you mentor or feel free to book an office hour (links are posted in the #office-hours channel of the Discord server) if you have any doubts!
