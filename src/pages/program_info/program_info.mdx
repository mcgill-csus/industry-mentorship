# CSUS Industry Mentorship Program

## Introduction
The Industry Mentorship Program is an intensive, hands-on opportunity for students who wish to learn new skills in order to be better equipped for working in the tech industry. The program offers students a series of lectures and workshops, while also providing support to work on a semester-long project.

Mentees can expect to become familiar with important software development concepts, best coding practices, and learn the secrets to succeeding in the tech industry.
The program covers several topics that are often out-of-scope or overlooked in the usual university courses.

Mentors benefits by gaining exposure in mentoring a small team of students, networking, giving lectures/talks, and improving their overall organization skills.

## Program Structure and Curriculum

The program is offered once per semester and will involve mentees working in teams of 2 to 4 students throughout its duration. In-person lectures would be offered every week, followed by a short post-lecture session to foster interaction between mentees and mentors.

Each team of mentees works towards a capstone project, where they can put the skills learned throughout the program into creating an application of their choice.
Each group would be assigned a mentor, who would be their primary point of contact regarding any logistics-related issues or guidance on projects. However, students would get many opportunities (such as office hours, post-lecture time, and social events) to interact with other mentors.

The program also involves several workshops on intriguing topics that are not covered in lectures. These workshops, conducted by software engineers, company representatives, former interns, or McGill ALumni offer a great opportunity for mentees to learn something out of the box from the right people.

## Topics Covered in Lectures
- Introduction to CLI and moden dev tools — useful UNIX utilities, dev tools, git, package managers, how to exit vim without destroying your computer, etc.
- Web dev basics — HTML/CSS briefing, MVC architecture (from the web dev context), software development lifecycle.
- Networks — HTTP/HTTPS, SSH, REST Architectural Pattern and RESTful APIs.
- Backend development - ExpressJS, routing, middleware, advanced concepts.
- Database – MongoDB, connecting MongoDB and ExpressJS, SQL vs no-SQL databases brief comparison.
- Frontend development - React.
- Software testing — unit testing, mocks and patches, info on other types of software testing such as integration tests, load tests, canaries, etc.
- Security and other advanced topics – user auth, API gateway, taking care of security tokens, hiding critical endpoints, websockets, microservices architecture.
- Deploying a web app – a how-to on popular deployment platforms and best practices, CI/CD.

## Workshops Offered
- Writing design docs and narratives -- an essential part of software development.
- Resume review session.
- Ethics, sustainability, and equity in tech.
- Intern Panel – how to make the best out of your internship, important takeaways, open-ended questions.
- Career paths in the tech industry.
- A/B and bandit testing.
- Hands-on ML – potentially collab with MAIS or some other ML company.

## Program Completion Requirements (Mentees)
- Attend all lectures (lectures would be recorded, however, in-person attendance is highly encouraged to get the most out of the program).
- Submit the required deliverables on time (deadline: 11:59 PM lecture day of the week, unless specified otherwise).
- Three weeks in: project proposal including the initial design doc.
- The week following the reading break: midpoint check-in including the updated project design doc.
- At least one week before the final presentation: final design doc.
- Complete and present the capstone project.

## FAQs
- Is there an enrollment cap on the number of mentees accepted into the program?

The actual numbers depend on how many mentors we can get on-board each semester, however, we expect to have around 40 students at the very minimum.

- I didn't get accepted to become a mentee? Can I still access the lecture content?

Yes, absolutely! All our content is freely available on this website. However, we won't be able to accommodate you for personal mentorship.

- How often would the workshops by software developers be held?

Depending upon how many SWEs/companies show interest in the program, we might add/remove/modify the prospective workshops offered.
Most likely, workshops would not be offered as frequently as the lectures. They instead aim to cover interesting/latest topics that are not taught in the lectures and university courses.

- Would there be a group-building session for mentees before the program starts?

Yes! We have an introductory session for all the the program participants at the beginning of the semester so that everyone gets to know each other, and those who applied without a team may get the chance to find potential project partners.

- Is there any official study material for this program? Would the mentees get handouts for each lecture topic covered?

Since this is the first iteration of the program, we will try our best to curate as many helpful resources as possible for the students. Everything is made available on this website once we are confident that the content is error-free and ready to be publicly distributed.
Students are also encouraged to look up information on topics on their own as it is an essential skill in software engineering.

- Would there be networking events and/or company booths to attend?

We try our best to get companies to host events for our cohort of mentees. Students are also encouraged to attend the TechFair organized by McGill each semester.

- Would there be any in-program competition and/or prizes for the best project? Any program swag?

We are planning on having prizes for the best three projects! More details will be revealed later.
Unfortunately, there would be no program-specific swag, but CSUS will be rolling out its official merch/swag during the semester, so keep an eye out for it!

- Is the program open to students not studying Computer Science?

Unfortunately, no. Students must be registered to computer science programs in Bachelor of Arts, Science, and Arts and Science in order to participate in this program.
We will do our best to accommodate as many students as possible as the program expands in scale in the future, but for now we are primarily focussing at the Computer Science student body at McGill.
